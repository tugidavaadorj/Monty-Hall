# Monty-Hall
A very simple yet interesting problem. You are a contestant on a show and are given a choice between three doors. Under one of the door is a brand new car, 
and the other two contain nothing. After you pick a door, the gameshow host (who knows the location of the car) reveals behind a door that you didn't pick.
Behind this door is nothing. So this means that the car is either behind the door you picked or the other (non-revealed) door.  

The gameshow host asks you if you want to change doors. Should you? What are the odds the car is behind the door you picked? 

This python program that I wrote simulates man games of this problem to determine win rate when you switch or stay. 

Hint: If you think there is now a 50/50 chance of winning the car, and whehter you switch or not makes a difference, you are wrong.
